LIST OF UPWORK TRACKER 
What the app tracks
When a freelancer turns the time tracker on, a client will see:


Images of the freelancer’s screen taken randomly 6 times an hour.

Number of keystrokes, mouse clicks, and scroll actions.
The app does not track what you click, what you type, applications you use, or webcam footage.
